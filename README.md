# Expenses Project

This is a basic project made with React for studying purposes. It's an expenses tracker where you can add, edit and delete your expenses. You can view your expenses by year with a chart of expenses and detailed information or you can view a summary of your expenses. The data is not persisted so it will reload every time the page is refreshed.

I coded along during the course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/#instructor-2) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller at Udemy.

# Expenses Project

This is a basic project made with React for studying purposes. It's an expenses tracker where you can add, edit and delete your expenses. You can view your expenses by year with a chart of expenses and detailed information or you can view a summary of your expenses.

I coded along during the course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/#instructor-2) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller at Udemy.

## My changes

Everything included in the first commit is from the original project. All later commits are changes that I made to the project. These changes include:
